Nowadays smartphones are becoming such a habitual in life as you can skip your water intake surprisingly but wouldn't be without a smartphone for the second. Every day we are blasting with new technology and the gadgets which keep you replacing your old favorite one. Let's say knowingly or unknowingly. This is a small attempt to indicate how many things can be possible with our dear "smartphone"

Camera: How many of you remember carrying your high-end DSLR last time? It's common to spot people clicking almost everywhere ! and that too without DSLR ( thanks to Instagram ).

MP3 Player/ Radio: Want to listen to a song? Tap the App and listen online. Who uses walkman in 2018? Almost none.

Calculator: According to recent survey sale of calculators gone down by 72 %, Do I need to say anymore?

GPS: Very much popular at the moment. Lost the plot. Is no one around to ask? No worries. Just open the map and navigate like a Columbus may be.

Scanner: This has been a great alternative tool. Just click the image of receipts, tickets, ids, invoices, notes, cards and go on. Kill that ugly flatbed scanner.

Flash drive: Remember the pain of losing your brand new 8GB pen drive decade ago? Not anymore. You can carry 1000 gigs of data easily ( virtually ) and can be used anywhere anytime. Cool.

Clock / Alarm / Timer: Excuse me, Whats the time? highly replaced by "Ok Google, what is the time right now ?"

Notepad/ Newspaper: This is a real beauty. You can scribe your silly ideas, ugly passwords, important numbers and to do list digitally without pen and paper :) Again reading news or articles with lots of customization is certainly cherry on the top.

This is not the end. This is a just miniature version. There are many more and always will be.
